# Remove temporary files from the guest
#
# Basic outline:
# 1. Section 1 of 'Main' loop:
#    Create a tmpfs file system and copy any existing files from the temp
#    directory to the new file system
# 2. Section 2 of 'Main' loop:
#    Mount the tmpfs file system over the top of the existing on-disk temp
#    files directory. This *hopefully* means than any process relying on
#    files in the temp directory will still have access to them and will
#    allow a clean shutdown while still allowing removal of all on disk
#    temp files.
#    Since tmpfs file systems live on memory the contents copied to them
#    will disappear on shutdown
# 3. Section 3 of 'Main' loop:
#    Once the tmpfs file system has been mounted the original on-disk temp
#    directory will no longer be directly accessible. In order to access
#    and clear any temp files from these disk areas we need to re-mount or
#    bind mount the device or file system on which the temp directory is
#    residing to an alternate location. We can then access and remove
#    any files from the disk by doing so from the alternate mount point.
